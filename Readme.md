# CentOS-5 singularity container bootstrap from a CentOS-7 host
- you need to install compat-db43 from either CentOS-6 or rebuild compat-db-4.6.21-17.el6.src.rpm on CentOS-7
- compat-db-4.6.21-17.el6.src.rpm and compat-db43-4.3.29-15.el6.x86_64.rpm pulled from CentOS-6
- replacing the original CentOS-Base.repo with one pointing to the archived vault.centos.org

# CentOS-5 has been End of Life (no support/no bug fix/...) since 31 March 2017.
